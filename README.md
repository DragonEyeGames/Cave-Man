Echofall is a chaotic 4 player FFA game where everyone is throwing stuff at eachother! Whether it be a lowly rock and the almighty fish, the weapon spawn is completely random.
This project had three requirements. It had to be physics based, have limited vision, and it also needed to have custom audio. 
The physics based led to the main idea of the game. throwing physics objects at eachother. We used rigid body 2d's as the projectiles to meet this requirement. It also made the game very fun!
The limited vision led to the main theming of the game. Because there was limited vision we decided to put it in a cave. This made the most sense and influenced two of the wepons. A rock and a boulder.
The custom audio was hard to make a focal point so I just had fun making all of the audio. I made it all myself except for the background music. I can't make very good music.

The physics based can be tested by playing the game. The code can be found in the 'rock' 'boulder' 'fish' and 'bomb' scenes. They all have custom scripts that inherit from a 'projectile' class.
The limited vision can be seen by playing the game and in the 'level 1' and 'level 2' scenes can be seen as the 'CanvasModulate'
The custom audio can be found on several nodes as 'AudioStreamPlayer's. They all have a custom sound attatched for fun.

Each OOP and Godot feature I want graded
The OOP feature of abstract class can be found in the 'projectile' script. That is the abstract class. It is implemented by the 'rock', 'bomb', 'fish', and 'boulder' scripts/scenes.
