The project went very well overall, especially because of the strong group I worked with. The main challenge I faced was on the UI, where I handled the Player 1–4 name fields. The alignment kept shifting, and at times the entire font would suddenly change, which made the process more confusing and time-consuming than expected. Even with those setbacks; eventually figured out the issues and got everything working the way it needed to. It was also surprising how quickly we progressed; achieving so much in just two to three weeks was genuinely impressive.
Through the process, I learned a lot about managing my time better and avoiding the habit of pushing work off. I also strengthened my skills with assets and art, which helped the project come together visually. Overall, the experience was challenging in the right ways and gave me lessons I can use to approach future projects more efficiently.
