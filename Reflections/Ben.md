I think that this was a very fun project to work on. It got me working on several things that I had never done before like the physics bodies, custom signals, and making my own audio. I also learned quite a bit about controller indexes to make multiplayer games with controllers which I want to implement into other things now!
I learned a lot throughout the course of the project and was also able to help others learn a lot as well. The most important thing I learned was how to use custom signals. That is a very powerful tool that I overlooked in previous projects. I have even implemnted it into several of my others projects because of how powerful it is. I also learned how to better use C# coding which will be very beneficial to future projects.
The biggest difficulty in this project was getting used to C#. I do all of my leisurely coding in GD Script so that swap was difficult. I got stuck on several issues because of ever so slight changes between the languages.
I was surprised as to how easy it was to get the main feature of the game up and running. Godot makes it very simple to have in depth physics functions. I thought that would take a long time to make but I had it done in the first or second day.
