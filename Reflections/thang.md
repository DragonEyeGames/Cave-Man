Throughout the project I've gone through some diffuclties, suprises and lessons that I learn. When I started the project I was not very good at understanding some of the stuff that were needed to get my code working for example like costume signals, and enums. They were difficult to understand and it made me very lost and stuck, but I had my group and teacher help me stay on track. They helped me with some part of the code that i needed help with and got me back on track in order for the project to be finshed. What I learned is that enums and costume signal is a very powerful tool that made coding easier, and made it less challenging.
